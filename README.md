2.  If no one is working on the project, pull the latest version of the project using 'git pull' 
		- Remember to open terminal and cd into the correct directory before typing commands
3. After pulling the latest project, feel free to edit your local version of the project.
4. After you are done with your completed changes, open terminal and cd into the correct directory
5. Type in 'git status'.
